🔍 CloudWatch is AWS's monitoring and observability service.

📊 It collects:
- Metrics (e.g., CPU, memory)
- Logs (e.g., app/server logs)
- Events (e.g., EC2 status changes)

📈 You can visualize this data using dashboards.


CloudWatch is like your **bike or car dashboard**:
- Speed → CPU usage
- Engine temp → Disk I/O
- Fuel level → Memory
- Red warning light → Alarm

It tells you when something goes wrong and helps you fix it.
