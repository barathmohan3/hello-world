🔍 CloudWatch is AWS's monitoring and observability service.

📊 It collects:
- Metrics (e.g., CPU, memory)
- Logs (e.g., app/server logs)
- Events (e.g., EC2 status changes)

📈 You can visualize this data using dashboards.


CloudWatch is like your **bike or car dashboard**:
- Speed → CPU usage
- Engine temp → Disk I/O
- Fuel level → Memory
- Red warning light → Alarm

It tells you when something goes wrong and helps you fix it.


Monitor health and performance of AWS resources  
📬 Get alerts via email/SMS when thresholds are crossed  
🔁 Automatically trigger actions (e.g., restart EC2)  
📉 Centralized log monitoring  
📊 Create custom dashboards


Core Components:
- Metrics: e.g., CPUUtilization
- Logs: App/system logs
- Alarms: Notify or act when thresholds are breached
- Dashboards: Graphs and charts
- Events: Automate reactions to changes


CloudTrail records every **API call** made in AWS.

It tracks:
- Who performed the action
- What action was taken
- When and from where

Used for **auditing, security, and compliance.**

Think of CloudTrail as **CCTV in a bank**:
- Records who entered (User)
- What they did (Create/Delete)
- When and how (Time, IP, Region)

It helps you investigate incidents and track history.

Know who did what in your AWS account  
🧾 Comply with audit and security policies  
🚨 Detect unauthorized access or changes  
🕰️ See all actions in the last 90 days (default)


🧱 Core Concepts:
- Events: Each API call (e.g., RunInstances)
- Event History: View 90 days by default
- Trails: Save logs in S3 for long-term use
- Insights: Detect unusual activity (e.g., login spike)

🔁 Works across regions and services
